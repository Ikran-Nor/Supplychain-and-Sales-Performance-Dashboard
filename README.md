# 🚚  Supply Chain & Sales Performance Dashboard | Power BI
 ## 📊  Project Overview
 In today’s fast-paced supply chain environment, understanding the full picture of operational efficiency, customer behavior, and product performance is critical to driving growth and profitability. In this end-to-end project, I performed data-transformation, modeling, and visual storytelling using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX to convert raw transactional data into a fully interactive dashboard revealing strategic business insights.
The project uncovers patterns in shipping performance, regional profitability, product discount strategies, and seasonal sales behavior, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions across operations, sales, and logistics.

## 💼 Business Objectives
Analyze regional and global revenue, profit, and volume performance.

Evaluate shipping mode efficiency and delivery performance.

Identify customer and product segments driving profitability.

Assess discount strategy impact on profit margin.

Recommend actionable strategies to optimize operations and sales performance.

## 🔍 Business Questions Analyzed
### 1️⃣ Operational Performance
Which shipping modes offer the most efficient and timely delivery?

How do delays, early arrivals, and on-time percentages vary across modes?

### 2️⃣ Sales and Profitability Trends
Which years, months, and categories contribute most to revenue and profit?

How do discount levels affect profit margins and overall revenue?

### 3️⃣ Regional and Segment Analysis
Which regions and departments are top performers?

Who are the highest-contributing customer types and payment methods?

## 📉 Problems Identified Based on Analysis
### 🔴 Shipping Inefficiencies
High delay rates in First Class (98%) and Second Class (77%) reduce delivery reliability and customer satisfaction.

### 🔴 Regional Disparities
Africa generates the lowest revenue and profit, despite a higher profit margin, signaling low volume but operational efficiency.

### 🔴 Discount-Driven Revenue Risks
High discount categories contribute more to revenue and profit, but result in lower profit margins—a red flag for long-term sustainability.

### 🔴 Seasonality Volatility
July had the highest revenue due to heavy discounting, while August—despite lower revenue—delivered the highest profit margin, proving cost efficiency wins.

### 🔴 Customer Behavior Gaps
While debit cards dominate payment usage (39.54%), the low usage of cash and transfers suggests untapped flexibility in customer experience.
