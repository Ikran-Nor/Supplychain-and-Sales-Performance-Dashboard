  * **Second Class**: 76.76% delayed, 22.97% on time (high delay rate).    
  * **First Class**: 98.45% delayed, 1.34% early arrival (least efficient).    
  * **Same Day**: 53.1% delayed, 4.22% early arrivals, 42.69% on-time deliveries (best for urgent shipping).   

### 🌍 Regional Insights: Identifying Geographic Opportunities
  * **Europe** generates the highest revenue and profit, indicating robust market performance and operational efficiency in the region.   
  * In contrast, **Africa** has the lowest revenue and profit, but interestingly, it achieves a higher profit margin (indicating cost-efficient operations).   
  This suggests potential for revenue growth if market penetration improves.
